            Hi, I'm Joshua, a current computer science student at Carleton university.
            
            Ever since I was a child, i love making/building things. So computers where really interesting for me when i was young util I was introduced 
            to programming in my second year of highschool. The first language i had to learn was JAVA.
            Since then I've programmed using several languages such as Python, C , C++, HTML/CSS, and javascript along with using some javascript framworks such as jQuery and Angular.
            Also, I've Developed several school projects and personal projects. 
            
            Hope you enjoy exploring my website :D
